* Feature: getAllProducts in HomeViewModel: the sample app pulls the data from local storage first to display,
 then update it using another call to remote repository.
* It doesn't have exception handler
* Performance: skip frames
* Flow: re-getProducts when click back button - need to recreate to debug.
